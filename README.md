# SCM_HW1_Wajd
This repository is for the Software Configuration Management (SCM) homework.
It demonstrates the use of GitHub for version control, branching, and change management.


## Best Practices in Software Configuration Management

1. **Use Version Control**: Track changes to the codebase and collaborate with others using tools like Git.
2. **Branching Strategy**: Use a branching strategy like Git Flow to manage features, bug fixes, and releases.
3. **Consistent Naming**: Ensure consistent naming conventions for files and branches.
4. **Documenting Changes**: Always write clear commit messages and document significant changes in the codebase.
5. **Code Review**: Use pull requests for code review and collaborative development.
